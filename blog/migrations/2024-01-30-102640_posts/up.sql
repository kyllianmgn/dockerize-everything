        'CSS Grid is an incredibly powerful tool for building layouts on the web, but like all powerful tools, there''s a significant learning curve. In this tutorial, we''ll build a mental model for how CSS Grid works and how we can use it effectively. I''ll share the biggest üí° lightbulb moments I''ve had in my own learning journey.',
        '<p>CSS Grid is one of the most amazing parts of the CSS language. It gives us a ton of new tools we can use to create sophisticated and fluid layouts.</p><p>It''s also surprisingly complex. It took me quite a while to truly become comfortable with CSS Grid!</p><p>In this tutorial, I''m going to share the biggest üí° lightbulb moments I''ve had in my own journey with CSS Grid. You''ll learn the fundamentals of this layout mode, and see how to do some pretty cool stuff with it. ‚ú®</p><blockquote><strong>Browser support?</strong><br><br>CSS Grid is the most modern tool for building layouts in CSS, but it isn''t exactly ‚Äúbleeding edge‚Äù; it''s been supported by all major browsers since 2017!<br>According to caniuse, CSS Grid is supported for 97.8% of users. This is excellent browser support; Flexbox is only about 0.5% more supported!</blockquote><h2>Mental model</h2><p>CSS is comprised of several different layout algorithms, each designed for different types of user interfaces. The default layout algorithm, Flow layout, is designed for digital documents. Table layout is designed for tabular data. Flexbox is designed for distributing items along a single axis.</p><p><a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/">Read more on Josh W. Comeau''s blog</a></p>',

        'In order to truly understand Rust, one needs to understand its crucial differentiating feature: ownership. Let‚Äôs go through it in detail the hard way.',
        '<p>This article is an introduction to Rust‚Äôs concept of ownership. It‚Äôs designed for someone who is already a programmer but who is not especially familiar (maybe even not at all familiar) with Rust. It doesn‚Äôt attempt to explain all the concepts it deals with, but for the most part it should be clear enough. If you‚Äôre a beginner you may also find that you don‚Äôt understand various parts of it; in such a case, you might like to hold the article while you go and learn more about them elsewhere; you‚Äôll find more value in coming back to this article after.</p><p>This concept of ownership is the pivotal part of Rust; it‚Äôs the part that makes its combination of efficiency and safety possible. While the rest of Rust is pretty similar to what you‚Äôll find in mainstream languages, so pattern matching and algebraic data types aren‚Äôt widespread in C‚Äêstyle languages, but they‚Äôre conceptually simple., these concepts of ownership and lifetimes are different from anything in any mainstream language, so it‚Äôs likely to be the part that you‚Äôll spend the longest trying to grok; if you don‚Äôt give up but persist, then when it all clicks, working in Rust will be a joy, and you‚Äôll have unlocked a marvellous ability to reason about code. You‚Äôll also probably wish you could transplant a lot of the aspects of Rust‚Äôs ownership model to other languages you deal with.</p><p>This article deals with the concepts and theory of ownership and lifetimes; it doesn‚Äôt provide much in the way of practical usage examples; those you can find elsewhere. But it does explain all the rules that go to make Rust‚Äôs ownership model what it is. (It is called ‚Äúthe hard way‚Äù for a reason.)</p><p><a href="https://chrismorgan.info/blog/rust-ownership-the-hard-way/">Read more on Chris Morgan''s blog.</a><p>',
